How to prepare the data using preprocessing, feature selection &amp; cross validation

We will be doing the data preparation and applying the feature selection techniques on a rather small cars dataset.

Part of the Plan:
Duplicates
Missing data
Outliers
Scaling
Encoding
Feature creation
Feature selection
